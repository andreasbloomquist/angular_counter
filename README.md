# MEAN Stack Exercise
While applying for jobs I wanted to create a counter to track how many companies
I applied to either via networking or by directly applying.

I also know I need more experience using Angular, so I figured this would be a
good opportunity to refresh my memory and practice creating SPAs using the MEAN
stack (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node).
